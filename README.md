## Description

Application to categorize, store and rate any data, like text, images, music, etc. 

### Primary function

The main idea is to implement a universal organizer for the most popular data types, such as text, music, images, with the ability to specify personal rating, comments, and tags to the data.

### Secondary function

To implement a smart data rating system, which will allow you to do not only the overall rating, but the rating by specific rate-tags.

What is rate-tag? Well, it's a tag with a rate. The idea is simple. Sometimes you like something, but not the whole thing, just some element in it. That's where the "rate-tags" come in. Create the rate-tag in rate it instead.

Examples:
- Element "Some apple from my favorite shop", rate-tags juicy-5, sweet-1
- Element "A photo of the ex.", rate-tags me-5, ex-1

Of course, these examples described in plain text are completely abstract, but the idea is the same - to give the user the opportunity to rate data by specifying a context of what he/she liked.

Also, save the time when the rating was made, so that in case the user changed his opinion, he could rate the data again. Such functionality will provide the user with a history of their tastes.
